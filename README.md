### 1. Usage
This Project is broken into three R-Markdown Files.
Each file is entirely independent of the others, if you are trying to run them in sequence, then be sure to clear the workspace before moving from one file to the next.

Part 1 - Attrition EDA: This file is a series of graphs and brief analytic tests to visualize and assess variable relationships with one another.

Part 2 - Testing and Initial Model: This file in an optional intermediate file. It serves as more of a catalog to how I moved from the initial EDA to the final part and how I determined which attributes to derive.

Part 3 - Derived Attributes and Final Model: This is the final file, that will train and test several models before using one to make a prediction.
